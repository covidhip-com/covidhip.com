# About Covid
Covid is not just a cold. 

It creates long term damage, and may be persistent in the body doing more damage. We don't understand how common this damage and long term impact is.

Every infection with covid puts you at higher risk.

We already know that even one Covid infection:

- [creates long term heart problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02000-0)

- [create "persistent pulmonary dysfunction in children and adolescents"](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.221250)
- [Damages your liver, and "it can exacerbate chronic liver conditions"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131221/)
- [Creates persistent inflammation in your brain](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00713-9)

- [Can create long-term thyroid dysfunction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13102818.2023.2170829)

- [Increases your risk of Diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e2.htm)

- [Increases your risk of Alzheimers disease for at least a year](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad220717)

- [Accelerates dementia](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/985010)

- [Inceases your risk of gut disorders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36223-7)

- [Weakens your immune system (t-cell dysfunction)](https://nn.neurology.org/content/10/4/e200097#sec-14)

- [Weakens your immune system (dendritic cell dysfunction)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00728-2#Sec2)

- [Makes bacterial infections more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134015/)

- Influences and possible accelerates [Breast Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35747796/) and [Lung Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033918/)

- [Can be detected in some people months after "recovery"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9057012/)

These may be true even for "mild" cases, and it appears the risk does not reduce for re-infections. 

Every infection increases your risk.

# Reducing your risk

Reduce the number of infections you have.

You can use active or passive protections.

- masks
- filtration
- outside air
- limit your exposure
