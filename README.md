# About Covid
Covid is not just a cold. Every infection with covid puts you at risk of many long term problems. There is overwhelming evidence that every infection can cause damage which will impact your long term health.

It may also stay in the body, and we do not yet know what the long term impact of this will be. Like other viruses which persist in our bodies, it may have disastrous long term impacts.

We already know that even one Covid infection can cause problems in your:

    - [Makes bacterial infections more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134015/)
    - ["a 42.63% higher likelihood of acquiring autoimmunity for patients who had suffered from COVID-19"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.25.23285014v1)

There is strong research that covid is associated with cancers:
- [Breast Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35747796/)
- [Lung Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033918/)
- ["SARS-CoV-2 infection affects many mechanisms that play a crucial role in cancer onset and progression"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908423001360?via%3Dihub#sec5)
- ["Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be considered a potential risk factor for increasing the probability of developing cancer"](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1894265/v1)

And evidence shows the virus lives within "recovered" people:
- [Can be detected months after "recovery"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9057012/)
- ["can spread systemically and persist for weeks to months."](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00115-5/fulltext)

These are true even for "mild" cases, and it appears the risk does not reduce for re-infections.

Every infection increases your risk. The only way to reduce your risk is to reduce the number of times you are infected.

# Common responses

- "I got over it" / "It was mild" / "I'm fine now".

The initial "cold-like" symptoms are not the whole story. Which tests have you done to prove you're not affected? Even if you have been lucky on your previous infections, will you be so lucky every time?

- "My new health problems aren't related to covid"

It can be months before the problems from a covid infection appear. If you've had covid, you are more likely to have progression of existing provlems, and develop new problems.

- "I want to go back to life as normal"

Life before 2020 is not coming back. We can make a new, safe normal, or you can hurt yourself or people you love. There are no other options.

- "If it was that bad, someone would have told me".

The [CDC](https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1529147728068063232?s=20) says 1 in 5 people will develop "a new condition a month or more after surviving #COVID19". The [NIH](https://covid19.nih.gov/covid-19-topics/long-covid) says "Either mild or severe COVID-19 can lead to long-lasting symptoms".

# Reducing your risk

Covid is airborne - you breathe it in from an infected person's breath, and it can stay in the air for a long time after being breathed out. So you need to remove the virus from the air you are breathing, or replace that air.

You can remove the virus from the air with:
- filtration, to treat a whole space
- masks, to treat the air you are breathing
- good airflow, bringing outside air in to replace possibly infectious air

And you can limit the amount of time you spend in enclosed spaces with infections people.

You need to use these as "layers of protection", and apply them together to reduce your risk.

| protection | detail |
|----|----|
| masks / respirators | N95 or P2 standard are the best, a common choice is the "3M Aura", this guide explains more: https://peoplescdc.org/2022/09/12/masking/ |
| air filtration | Some kinds of filters can remove the virus from the air. ["Corsi-Rosenthal Boxes"](https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/) are an easy to build, cheap solution for this. |
| outside air | Bringing air from outside into your shared spaces can dilute the amount of virus you are exposed to, if someone else is carrying it. Open a window or door, and keep the air moving through. |
| limit your exposure | Reduce your risk by reducing the time you spend in enclosed spaces with potentially contagious people. |
