# About Covid
Covid is a disease which has multiple impacts across the body. 

## Acute effects (the first two weeks)
- damage to cardiovascular organs
	- some of this will be permanent
- damage to brain
	- "brain fog"
	- loss of sense of smell (anosmia)
	- depression, dementia, etc ..
	- this is probably permanent damage.
- immune dysfunction
	- we don't know how much of this is permanent

In some people there is permanent damage or persistence of the virus leading to long term impacts.

## Chronic effects (ongoing)
- degenerative mental and cognitive decline
- Immune dysfunction
	- Increased likelihood of cancers
	- Increased susceptibility to other infections

There is another virus which has similar impact to the immune system, and its long term effects and mechanisms are well known and disastrous.

# Covid Studies And Impacts

## Immune system dysfunction:

### T-Cell Dysfunction

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1155770/full
>We report that Neuro-PASC patients exhibit distinct immunological signatures composed of elevated CD4+ T cell responses and diminished CD8+ memory T cell activation

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220925/
> Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4+ T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33382973/
> The CSF of Neuro-COVID patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4+ T cells.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36510222/
> Persistent alterations in inflammatory pathways and T-cell activation/exhaustion markers for months after active infection may help shed light on the pathophysiology of a prolonged post-viral syndrome observed following recovery from COVID-19 infection

https://nn.neurology.org/content/10/4/e200097#sec-14
> Indeed, some similar features, including T-cell exhaustion and B-cell activation, were identified in previous studies of peripheral blood cells of presumably fully recovered patients, sometimes even 10 months after a mild COVID-19 infection. Other reports showed that the subgroup with PASC had a more distinct and significant pattern of T-cell exhaustion.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10017386/
> The deterioration of CD8+ T cell function is seen in patients with active viral infections that had been either eliminated, in the case of HCV or greatly reduced (HIV). This dysfunction persists for a year or more after the active phase of infection, suggesting lasting damage, despite the absence or near absence of the relevant virus.

### Dendritic cell dysfunction

https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1009742#abstract0
> Persistent downregulation of CD86 and upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in conventional DCs (cDC2 and DC3) and classical monocytes associated with a reduced capacity to stimulate naïve CD4+ T cells correlated with disease severity. Long-lasting depletion and functional impairment of DCs and monocytes may have consequences for susceptibility to secondary infections and therapy of COVID-19 patients.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00728-2#Sec2
> Importantly, this long-term defects related to DC migration and tolerogenesis (integrin β7 and IDO expression) were present independently of whether or not the patients were previously hospitalized.

> Some DC activation markers are not normalized neither in previously hospitalized nor in nonhospitalized patients 7 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection

### Increased secondary infections

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134015/
> These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 increases susceptibility and pathogenicity to bacterial coinfection, and further studies are needed to understand and combat disease associated with bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9867601/
> In summary, this retrospective cohort study demonstrated that COVID-19 patients would carry a significantly higher risk of MRSA infections, including MRSA bacteremia, than patients with influenza.

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.12.23289898v1
> Among 228,940 children aged 0-5 years, the risk for first-time medically attended RSV during 10/2022-12/2022 was 6.40% for children with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 4.30% for the matched children without COVID-19 (risk ratio or RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27-1.55); and among 99,105 children aged 0-1 year, the overall risk was 7.90% for those with prior COVID-19 infection, higher than 5.64% for matched children without (RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.21-1.62). These data provide evidence that COVID-19 contributed to the 2022 surge of severe pediatric RSV cases.


## Possible persistence 
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38682-4#Abs1
>Our analysis indicates heterogeneity in PASC and identified subsets with distinct signatures of persistent inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-κB signaling (particularly associated with TNF), appear to be the most differentially enriched signaling pathways, distinguishing a group of patients characterized also by a persistent neutrophil activation signature.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9057012/
>We report expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gut mucosa ∼7 months after mild acute COVID-19 in 32 of 46 patients with IBD. Viral nucleocapsid protein persisted in 24 of 46 patients in gut epithelium and CD8+ T cells.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(23)00142-X/fulltext
> They found SARS-CoV-2 RNA widely distributed in 84 distinct anatomical locations up to 230 days after infection


## Cardiovascular Impacts

### Large summary
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1213111/full
> ...leading to cardiomyocyte fibrosis, endothelial damage, mediating inflammatory responses and vasoconstriction, and accelerating cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure’s further progression

> ...COVID-19 was found to trigger increased expression of NETs through multiple mechanisms, and NETs play an important role in the transition from acute to chronic persistent neocoronavirus infection

> ...In addition to this, epigenetic reprogramming of hematopoietic progenitor cells and cellular dysregulation may be involved in the clinical manifestations of the long COVID cardiovascular system, but the above mechanisms are only highly speculative, and the exact pathological process needs to be further clarified
> ...The invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into humans is found to increase the host cell’s stress response and induce cellular senescence, which increases the pro-inflammatory, tissue-damaging senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)

> ...patients who died from neointimal pneumonia suggested the presence of endothelial inflammation and degradation of endothelial cells in multiple organs throughout the body, and the presence of viral structures in endothelial cells was observed by electron microscopy

> ...This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can cause impaired endothelial structure and function and reduce vascular barrier function, providing strong theoretical support for the mechanism of virus-endothelial cell interaction

> ...several studies have demonstrated that COVID-19 can induce the development of insulin resistance, which increases the incidence of cardiovascular disease and more severe infectious complications.

> ...Baier et al. demonstrated for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause an imbalance in iron homeostasis and intracellular iron accumulation, leading to decreased iron storage capacity, which induces ROS production to cause increased oxidative stress and cellular damage in cardiomyocytes. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and iron metabolism disorders was also demonstrated by Han et al. SARS-CoV-2 induces ferroptosis in human sinoatrial node pacemaker cells, causing severe lipid peroxidation, which results in pacing dysfunction and bradycardia

> In addition to ACE2-mediated viral entry, endothelial dysfunction, iron homeostasis imbalance, and psychosocial factors involved in pathological development, severe electrolyte disturbances, respiratory failure, and impaired mitochondria can also lead to cardiac involvement


### Hypertension

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019483223001037?via%3Dihub
> We found that 32.3% of the population had new onset of hypertension at 1 year follow-up post-COVID-19 disease recovery


### Anemia 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9263052/
> Hemolytic anemia has been linked to COVID-19 through induction of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) caused by the formation of autoantibodies (auto-Abs) or directly through CD147 or erythrocyte Band3 protein-mediated erythrocyte injury.


## Other organs

### Liver 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131221/
> SARS-CoV-2 is notorious for causing acute liver injury through various mechanisms. While most of the time it causes a self-resolving acute liver injury, it can exacerbate chronic liver conditions with an associated increase in morbidity and mortality.

### Diabetes

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e2.htm
> Diabetes risk was 166% higher in the COVID-19 group than in the non-COVID-19 group (HR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.98–3.56)

### Lungs


https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.221250
> showed persistent pulmonary dysfunction in children and adolescents who recovered from COVID-19 and those with long COVID.

### Thyroid

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13102818.2023.2170829
> Thyroid dysfunction was registered in 61.1% of the patients (78.3% subclinical hypothyroidism, 13% subclinical hyperthyroidism and 8.7% overt hypothyroidism) two months after COVID-19.
> ... At the follow-up, the subclinical hypothyroidism persisted in 28.3% of the subjects. Moreover, the TSH level was significantly reduced in comparison to the second month after the initial COVID-19 infection in all the patients (_p_ < 0.001), but not in those with subclinical hypothyroidism and without hormone replacement therapy. Our findings indicate that COVID-19 could have long-term, negative effects on thyroid function.



### Gut changes

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36223-7
> We show that beyond the first 30 days of infection, people with COVID-19 exhibited increased risks and 1-year burdens of incident gastrointestinal disorders spanning several disease categories including motility disorders, acid related disorders (dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease), functional intestinal disorders, acute pancreatitis, hepatic and biliary disease.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36591612/
>Compared with controls, patients with COVID-19 reported higher rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) according to Rome IV criteria: 0.5% versus 3.2%, p=0.045. Factors significantly associated with IBS diagnosis included history of allergies, chronic intake of proton pump inhibitors and presence of dyspnoea. At the 6-month follow-up, the rate of patients with COVID-19 fulfilling the criteria for depression was higher than among controls.


## Brain changes

https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217232120
> Collectively, our findings suggest that subtle changes in white matter extracellular water content last beyond the acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. 

https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg2248
> We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces fusion between neurons and between neurons and glia in mouse and human brain organoids. We reveal that this is caused by the viral fusogen, as it is fully mimicked by the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or the unrelated fusogen p15 from the baboon orthoreovirus. We demonstrate that neuronal fusion is a progressive event, leads to the formation of multicellular syncytia, and causes the spread of large molecules and organelles

https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2022/01/422156/cerebrospinal-fluid-offers-clues-post-covid-brain-fog
> They found that 10 of 13 participants with cognitive symptoms had anomalies in their cerebrospinal fluid. But all four of the cerebrospinal samples from participants with no post-COVID cognitive symptoms were normal. The research publishes on Jan. 18, 2022 in _Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology_.

https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00713-9
> Taken together, the findings presented here illustrate that even mild respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in persistent neuroinflammatory changes and consequent dysregulation of neural cell types important for healthy cognitive function"


## Cognitive decline

https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-023-00357-x
>Importantly, the COVID-19 patients over 50 years (61.9 ± 7.4 years, _n_ = 100), but not those younger than 50 years (34.2 ± 9.5 years, _n_ = 115), showed significantly lower total scores of MoCA and MMSE than controls (62.0 ± 7.3 years, _n_ = 100; 34.3 ± 8.8 years, _n_ = 115) (both _P_ < 0.05, Fig. [1](https://translationalneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40035-023-00357-x#Fig1)b).

https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad220717
>we show that people with COVID-19 were at significantly increased risk for new diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease within 360 days after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis (hazard ratio or HR:1.69, 95% CI: 1.53–1.72), especially in people age ≥85 years and in women.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2805366?resultClick=1
> Persistent depressive symptoms, often accompanied by cognitive symptoms, commonly occur after COVID-19 illness (hereinafter termed _COVID-DC_, DC for depressive and/or cognitive symptoms). 

https://journals.lww.com/nrronline/fulltext/2023/07000/alzheimer_s_disease_risk_after_covid_19__a_view.2.aspx
> Reported results regarding the cognitive decline in a significant portion of COVID-19 patients, Aβ and tau pathways altered by SARS-CoV-2, neurotoxic glial profile in response to the virus, and brain changes in discrete regions related to learning/memory, made us aware of a possible etiological link between this viral infection and AD. Although undesirable, the COVID pandemic will indeed allow scientists to explore the infectious hypothesis prospectively in a wide population.

https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/985010
> "All subtypes of dementia, irrespective of patients’ previous dementia types, behaved like rapidly progressive dementia following COVID-19, according to the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease Reports"



## Links to cancer / tumours / melanoma / leukemia

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.845558/full
> We report three cases of malignant melanoma (MM) associated with severe COVID-19, the first two with amelanotic melanoma and the third with hypopigmented melanoma.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36013-7
> A significant higher risk was found concerning renal (aHR 3.16, 95% CI 2.33–4.27), hematological (aHR 2.54, 95% CI 2.07–3.12), colon (aHR 1.72, 95% CI 1.34–2.21), and lung (aHR 1.70, 95% CI 1.39–2.08) cancers. This suggests that a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a marker of an undiagnosed cancer.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033918/
> Indeed, the onset, progression, and prognosis of the two diseases may in some cases influence each other, and inflammation is an important link between them. The original chronic inflammatory environment of lung cancer patients may increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 and exacerbate secondary damage. Meanwhile, the acute inflammation caused by COVID-19 may induce tumour progression or cause immune activation

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35747796/
> Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection might promote the ability of aggressive BCC to induce the malignant phenotypes of the other non-aggressive BCC. Taken together, these findings suggested an increased risk of poor outcomes in TNBC patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which required a long-term follow-up.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37260157/
> We found that in comparing pre-COVID to COVID-era data that breast cancer patients presented with higher stages, in particular, stage 3 or higher stage disease.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137922000050#sec0003
> Considering the relatively rapid development of [cytopenias](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cytopenia "Learn more about cytopenias from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") following recovery from COVID-19, it cannot be ruled out that SARS-Cov-2 played a role in leukemogenesis in those patients
