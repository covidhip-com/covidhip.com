## Summary

Covid is not just a cold. Every infection with covid puts you at risk of many long term problems. There is overwhelming evidence that every infection can cause damage which will impact your long term health.

It may also stay in the body, and may have disastrous long term impacts.

We already know that even one Covid infection can cause problems in your:

There is strong research that covid is associated with cancers:

- [Breast Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35747796/)
- [Lung Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033918/)
- ["SARS-CoV-2 infection affects many mechanisms that play a crucial role in cancer onset and progression"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908423001360?via%3Dihub#sec5)
- ["Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can be considered a potential risk factor for increasing the probability of developing cancer"](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1894265/v1)

Evidence shows the virus lives within "recovered" people long after the acute infection.

- [Can be detected months after "recovery"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9057012/)
- ["can spread systemically and persist for weeks to months."](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(23)00115-5/fulltext)

The damage Covid does is detectable years after the infection, even for asymptomic infections.

-  [Epigenetic liquid biopsies reveal elevated vascular endothelial cell turnover and erythropoiesis in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.28.550957v1)
- [Multimodal Molecular Imaging Reveals Tissue-Based T Cell Activation and Viral RNA Persistence for Up to 2 Years Following COVID-19](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.23293177v1)

Every infection increases your risk. The only way to reduce your risk is to reduce the number of times you are infected.

The best way to reduce the risk of people around you, is to not get infected, and if you do, don't infect anyone else.

## Common Responses

- "I got over it" / "It was mild" / "I'm fine now".

The initial "cold-like" symptoms are not the whole story. Which tests have you done to prove you're not affected? Even if you have been lucky on your previous infections, will you be so lucky every time?

There _will_ be a next time, each infection carries limited protection to future variants, and each infection does you some amount of damage.

You're likely accumulating damage for no long-term benefit.

- "Its getting milder over time"

It really isn't. Over time the severity is [increasing](https://www.idse.net/Covid-19/Article/07-23/COVID-Reinfection-Cases-Severe-Outcomes-Have-Increased-Over-Time/70906), and there's no guarantee future variants will be milder.

- "My new health problems aren't related to covid"

It can be months before the problems from a covid infection appear. If you've had covid, you are more likely to have progression of existing provlems, and develop new problems.

- "I want to go back to life as normal"

Life before 2020 is not coming back. We can make a new, safe normal, or you can hurt yourself or people you love. There are no other options.

- "If it was that bad, someone would have told me".

The [CDC](https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1529147728068063232?s=20) says 1 in 5 people will develop "a new condition a month or more after surviving #COVID19".

The [NIH](https://covid19.nih.gov/covid-19-topics/long-covid) says "Either mild or severe COVID-19 can lead to long-lasting symptoms".

- "I'm vaxed and relaxed"

While the vaccines reduce severity of the initial infection, there is conflicting data about Long Covid and other long term impacts.

- "What about children?"

Covid also bad for children, although they may not be as affected in the acute phase, the long term impact looks similar to adults.

The NIH says that:

> “The incidence of post-COVID symptoms in children appears to increase with age. The most common symptoms reported include persistent fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal symptoms, and an altered sense of smell."
>
> " ... Cardiopulmonary injury, neurocognitive impairment, and new-onset diabetes may occur.”

## Reducing Risk

Covid is airborne - you breathe it in from an infected person's breath, and it can stay in the air for a long time after being breathed out. So you need to remove the virus from the air you are breathing, or replace that air.

You can remove the virus from the air with:

- filtration, to treat a whole space
- masks, to treat the air you are breathing
- good airflow, bringing outside air in to replace possibly infectious air

And you can limit the amount of time you spend in enclosed spaces with infections people.

You need to use these as "layers of protection", and apply them together to reduce your risk.

| protection | detail |
|----|----|
| masks / respirators | N95 or P2 standard are the best, a common choice is the "3M Aura", this guide explains more: [People's CDC - Masking](https://peoplescdc.org/2022/09/12/masking/) |
| air filtration | Some kinds of filters can remove the virus from the air. ["Corsi-Rosenthal Boxes"](https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/) are an easy to build, cheap solution for this. |
| outside air | Bringing air from outside into your shared spaces can dilute the amount of virus you are exposed to, if someone else is carrying it. Open a window or door, and keep the air moving through. |
| limit your exposure | Reduce your risk by reducing the time you spend in enclosed spaces with potentially contagious people. |
