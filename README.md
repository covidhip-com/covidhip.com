# About Covid
Covid is not just a cold. 

It creates long term damage, and may be persistent in the body doing more damage. We don't understand how common this damage and long term impact is.

Every infection with covid puts you at higher risk.

We already know that even one Covid infection:

- [Can create long term heart problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02000-0)

- [Can create "persistent pulmonary dysfunction in children and adolescents"](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.221250)
 
- [Damages your liver, and "it can exacerbate chronic liver conditions"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131221/)
  
- [Creates persistent inflammation in your brain](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00713-9)

- [Can create long-term thyroid dysfunction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13102818.2023.2170829)

- [Increases your risk of Diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e2.htm)

- [Increases your risk of Alzheimers disease for at least a year](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad220717)

- [Accelerates dementia](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/985010)

- [Inceases your risk of gut disorders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36223-7)

- [Weakens your immune system (t-cell dysfunction)](https://nn.neurology.org/content/10/4/e200097#sec-14)

- [Weakens your immune system (dendritic cell dysfunction)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00728-2#Sec2)

- [Makes bacterial infections more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9134015/)

- Influences and possibly accelerates [Breast Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35747796/) and [Lung Cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37033918/)

- [Can be detected in some people months after "recovery"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9057012/)

These may be true even for "mild" cases, and it appears the risk does not reduce for re-infections. 

Every infection increases your risk.

# Common responses

- "I got over it" / "It was mild" / "I'm fine now".

Which tests have you had done to prove you're not affected? You probably do have damage from covid, you're just not testing for it. Even if you have been lucky on your previous infections, will you be so lucky every time? 

# Reducing your risk

Reduce the number of infections you have.

You can use active or passive protections.

- masks
- filtration
- outside air
- limit your exposure
